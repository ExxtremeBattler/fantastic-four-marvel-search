## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a program that allows a user to search for a MARVEL Comics character, and recieve miscellaneous informnation about said character, such as comics and movies they appear in.

Throughout this project, all 4 of us have learnt much about teamwork, GitHub workflow, Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

## Installation

N/A, a web browser will do.

## Usage

(Note that, upon opening the website, random comic and character information will be displayed by default.)

To use the program, click on the search bar to enter a character of your choosing. Once entered, click 'Search'.

The website will now display various information about said character for your viewing pleasure.

The last 5 searches will be saved in a list, to the right of the search bar. Clicking any particular saved character in this list will fetch the relevant information for them once more.
